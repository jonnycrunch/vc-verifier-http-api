An experimental open API specification for verifying digital credentials based
on standards such as the Verifiable Credentials Data Model
(https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/). Implementations are expected to change
significantly and implementers that are not directly involved in the work are
strongly urged to not implement this API. Implementations of this API may differ
in terms of which data formats or proof formats they do or do not support.
Implementations may choose to not support certain parts of this API (e.g.
optional parts include retrieving a verification status that has already been
created).
